# Roguelike Map Generators

These are a collection of 2D map generators written in Python. It's inspired by
and designed primarily for roguelikes.

Currently, I'm interested in experimenting with different generation algorithms
and creating new ones for specific locations (a beach town, village, church,
etc).

Ideally, in the long run these algorithms will be language agnostic and
generate a simple, portable output file.
